# starter-pete-thinkful-portfolio
This project aims to redesign the earlier impletation of an Artist's details

Navigation Section, About and Portfolio Sections have been redesigned.
Most of the page section have been aligned side-by-side.
Examples of the layout out changes:
- Image in About Section and Text under I'm Pete Thinkful have been placed side by side
- Portfolio Images and associated details are also placed side by side
- Overall page is more center-aligned

Implementation details:
- Flex layout with parent-child style sheet definitions have been widely used
- Flex layout with parent-child combination assists in placing the divs side-by-side
- Portfolio images were required to take the entire space available in div 
    - this was accomplished by setting max-width:100% property
    - Margin between portfolio images by set using margin-left, margin-right, padding-left, padding-right properties
